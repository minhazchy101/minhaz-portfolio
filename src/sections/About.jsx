          About Me
        </h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I'm Minhaz from Sylhet, Bangladesh — a passionate learner who enjoys building websites that live on the internet. From the very beginning of my learning journey, I was deeply curious about how code works. That curiosity led me to start with HTML and CSS, and soon I discovered the exciting world of web development, including JavaScript, React, and more.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          At first, I loved working with HTML and CSS. But when I stepped into JavaScript and started exploring core concepts seriously, I faced real challenges. Those struggles, however, pushed me to stay committed and helped me grow stronger as a learner.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Outside of coding, I enjoy reading books and traveling. I'm especially fond of novels and exploring new genres. Traveling helps me recharge and connect with friends and family, making every journey memorable.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          These days, I'm spending most of my time with code and books. From a book lover to a code learner — I'm truly enjoying the journey, by the grace of Allah.
